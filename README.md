Instructions
Complete the following steps:

1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
    - Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

    - Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

    - Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

    - Use otu_ids for the x values.

    - Use sample_values for the y values.

    - Use sample_values for the marker size.

    - Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

    - Use otu_labels for the text values.

4. Display the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

    - Loop through each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object and create a text string.

    - Append an html tag with that text to the #sample-metadata panel.

5. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard. An example dashboard is shown as follows:

6. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file

I used ChatGpt and class resources to code this file.
